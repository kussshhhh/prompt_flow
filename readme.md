prompt_flow

prompts are functions.
they should be reusable and unitary and made and stored in a way that can be retrieved easily. 

im writing so many prompts there are some that i just repeat well not whole but like the some of it and mix andx	 match write and clipboard might not be it 

first imma use raycast to see if it can take care of all my prompting needs (storage and retrieval) 

oh also store all your prompts across claude code and claude ide and see if there are any patterns, and prompt in a way that you know these prompts can be reusable and broken down.
